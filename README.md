# IBP-Assignment-2
This repository was created to store the files used to do the assignment regarding the Enron Database, where we had to analyse the Enron Mailset in Google colab using Python to understand and use SQLite Database to do data exploration and visualisation while applying the industry best practices.

In this repository, there are two notebooks:

The Development Report notebook: contains the pseudocode that I use to write the code for the Enron Database to check for the schema of the tables and the SQL queries that were converted to dataframe to perform analysis on the data through graphs. The notebook also contains the errors we found during testing, how we solved them, and the industry's best practices that we could not apply to this assignment.

The Business Report contains the code used to do the assignment; the graph used to analyse the data retrieved, and the discussion of the data.

This repository also contains a Non-Conformance Report that elaborates on the issues we had while writing the codes and could not solve. In this file, we also elaborate on why we could not solve these issues and how they could be solved or avoided from happening again.
